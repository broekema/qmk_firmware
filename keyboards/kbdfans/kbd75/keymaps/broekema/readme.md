# KBDfans KBD75 rev2

This keymap is based on a KDB75 rev2 with an ISO layout, a 1.25U left
shift, 1U right alt, FN and ctrl, and an extra 1U key left of Z.

Apart from the default functions on layer 1, this keymap introduced
volume control on - and + (mute on 0) and playback control on , . and
/.

System power is accesible via FN-ESC. Caps lock and the extra key
between left shift and Z are mapped to Ctrl-PGUP and Ctrl-PGDN
respectively, corresponding to 'previous tab' and 'next tab' in many
popular applications.

FN-arrows controls the mouse, and the modifier keys either side of FN
are mapped to the corresponding mouse buttons on layer 1.
